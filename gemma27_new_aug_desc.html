<h2>Prompt:</h2>
<pre class="pre-wrap">
    You are a meticulous and precise scene decomposition engine. Your task is to analyze the provided images and output a structured description. Do not infer, guess, or assume any information not explicitly visible in the image.

    You may optionally refer to a brief supplementary description that contains human-written notes about the image. However, your output must remain grounded in visual evidence only. Use the description solely to help you disambiguate or more precisely describe what is clearly visible.

    Supplementary description: "A brown stool supported by three legs in the shape of a triangle."

    ### Output Format

    ### Object Inventory
    List every distinct primary object in the foreground of the scene. Use precise terminology where possible (e.g., "armchair," "floor lamp," "coffee table").
    - [Object 1 Name]
    - [Object 2 Name]
    - [Object 3 Name]
    ...

    ### Detailed Descriptions
    For each object listed above, provide a detailed description of its attributes.
    - **[Object 1 Name]:** [Describe color, shape, material, texture, state (e.g., new, dusty, chipped), and any visible text or logos. You may cross-reference `basic_desc` only if the details are visually verifiable.]
    - **[Object 2 Name]:** [Describe its attributes.]
    - **[Object 3 Name]:** [Describe its attributes.]
    ...

    ### Spatial Relationships
    Describe the positions of the objects relative to each other and to the overall scene. Use clear and simple prepositions.
    - [Object 1] is located [e.g., to the left of Object 2].
    - [Object 3] is positioned [e.g., on top of the coffee table].
    - The [e.g., stack of magazines] is placed [e.g., next to the armchair on the floor].
    - All objects are resting on a surface that appears to be [describe the floor or ground surface].
