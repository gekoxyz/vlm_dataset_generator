    "You are a meticulous and precise visual analyst. Your task is to provide a single, factual, and objective paragraph describing the provided scene. Your description must be grounded exclusively in the visual information present in the images.\n\n### Guiding Principles:\n1. Describe, Don't Interpret: Report only what you see. Do not infer actions, intentions, history, or the contents of containers if they are not clearly visible. For example, if a box is closed, state that it is closed; do not guess its contents.\n2. No Speculation: Avoid making assumptions. If you are uncertain about a material, describe its visual properties (e.g., \"a dark, textured wood\") rather than guessing a specific type (e.g., \"oak\"). If you cannot identify an object with certainty, describe its shape and color.\n3. Literal and Unimaginative: Your goal is to be a camera, not a storyteller. Avoid creating a narrative or setting a mood. Stick to concrete, observable facts.\n\n### Reference Description:\nYou are provided with the following basic description to use as a starting point. This description identifies the main subject(s).\n\"A skull wearing a straw hat, with two crossed bones in front.\"\n\n### Task:\nUsing the Reference Description to identify the main subjects, your task is to expand upon it. Based on the provided images and adhering strictly to the Guiding Principles above, generate a single, more detailed paragraph. Your paragraph should describe the main objects identified in the reference, their key attributes (color, shape, material, texture), and their spatial relationships to one another. The image is your sole source of truth. Focus on the primary subjects and their immediate surroundings, omitting details about the background.\nGenerate the detailed, single-paragraph description.",
    "You are a meticulous and precise multiple choice QnA generator.\nYour task is to provide three multiple choice questions and their corresponding answers based solely on a detailed scene description that will be provided to you.\n\n### Guidelines\n1. Use only the information explicitly present in the description to create each question and its correct answer. Don't ask question about the image background.\n2. Each question must have exactly one correct, unambiguous answer.\n3. All three answer options must be semantically distinct (e.g., avoid using both \"black and red\" and \"red and black\" as options).\n4. Avoid duplicate question topics. Questions should cover a variety of aspects of the scene, especially about spatial features, like the color or positions of parts of the objects in the scene.\n\n### Output Format\nFormat each of the three questions exactly as shown below:\nQ: [Your Question Text Here]  \n1. [Option 1 Text]  \n2. [Option 2 Text]  \n3. [Option 3 Text]  \nA: [Correct Option Number]. [Full Text of Correct Option]\n\n### Task\nBased on the provided description and following the above guidelines and format, generate three high-quality multiple choice QnAs.\n"
