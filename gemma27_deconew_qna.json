    "You are a meticulous and literal scene-decomposition engine.  \nYour task is to inspect the provided images and output a structured report of what is visually present; nothing more, nothing less.  \nIf a brief supplementary description is supplied, use it only to disambiguate what you can already see; never let it override visual evidence.\n\nSupplementary description: \"A small mouse statue interacts with flowers in various ways.\"\n\n---\n## OUTPUT FORMAT  (follow *exactly*)\n\n### 1. Object Inventory  \nList every distinct, foreground object that can participate in spatial relations.  \nUse specific, conventional names (e.g., \u201cceramic mug,\u201d \u201cfloor lamp,\u201d \u201claptop\u201d).  \n- [Object 1 Name]  \n- [Object 2 Name]  \n- ...\n\n### 2. Object Attributes  \nFor each object above, describe only what is visually certain.  \n- [Object 1 Name]: color(s); shape/form factor; visible material(s); surface condition (e.g., glossy, dusty, chipped); any readable text or logo.  \n- [Object 2 Name]: \u2026  \n- ...\n\n### 3. Spatial Relationships  \nDescribe how objects are placed **relative to one another** (not to the camera).  \nUse simple prepositions (left/right, above/below, in front of/behind, on, inside, leaning against, etc.).  \nEach bullet must reference at least two named objects and be verifiably true from the image.  \n- [Object A] is to the left of [Object B].  \n- [Object C] rests on top of [Object D].  \n- ...\n\n---\n## STRICT GUIDELINES\n\n1. No inference or speculation: If you cannot see an attribute, omit it.  \n2. Foreground focus: Ignore distant background details unless they interact spatially with listed objects.  \n3. Name once, reference consistently: Use identical spelling when referring to an object in attributes and relationships.  \n4. No duplicate facts: State each spatial relation only once.  \n5. Visual evidence only: Closed containers reveal nothing about their contents.  \n6. Brevity + precision: Keep sentences short and factual; avoid narrative or opinion.\n\nYour entire output must exactly match the structure above. Do not add sections, commentary, or metadata beyond what is specified.\nPlease analyze the scene using the given instructions.",
    "You are a meticulous and precise multiple choice QnA generator.\nYour task is to provide three multiple choice questions and their corresponding answers based solely on the provided scene decomposition.\n\n### Guidelines\n1. Use only the information explicitly present in the scene description. Do not infer or assume anything beyond what is stated.\n2. Each question must be based on spatial aspects of the scene such as positions, orientations, or relationships between objects (e.g., \"to the left of,\" \"above,\" \"near,\" etc.).\n3. Do not create questions about object colors, materials, or the background. Focus strictly on spatial features and object arrangements.\n4. Each question must have exactly one correct answer.\n5. All answer choices must be semantically distinct; avoid rewordings or rearrangements that convey the same meaning.\n6. Ensure that no two questions focus on the same spatial detail or object relationship.\n\n### Output Format\nFormat each of the three questions exactly as shown below:\nQ: [Your Question Text Here]  \n1. [Option 1 Text]  \n2. [Option 2 Text]  \n3. [Option 3 Text]  \nA: [Correct Option Number]. [Full Text of Correct Option]\n\n### Task\nBased on the provided scene decomposition and following the above guidelines and format, generate three high-quality multiple choice QnAs.\n"
